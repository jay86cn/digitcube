  Using webpack, vue2 and other popular technology stack, by calling self-developed components and chart components, you can quickly deploy online without too much tedious development process, greatly shortening the development cycle. Truly free development at source level.

- **🧩De-bitmap to fully use SVG**

  Full vectorisation (de-bitmap), due to the special use scenario of visualisation of large screens, the use of traditional bitmap situation graphics zoom details blurred, while the use of vector graphics details scaled can still maintain the original details clarity.

- **📊Enterprise splicing screen**

  In the face of the enterprise splicing screen, we have a very large number of display solutions, according to the customer's splicing screen equipment situation for custom development. The best display effect can be achieved under any equipment.

- **🧑‍ Internationalisation**

  Aimed at global business and expanding market coverage, internationalisation can improve user satisfaction, reduce development and maintenance costs and increase the scalability of the software.

- **🚀Steady iterations for rapid response**

  The framework has gone through two major releases and numerous minor iterations, with timely bug fixes and steady feature expansion. For paid users can be achieved in a timely response.

## 📜 Update notes

- **20230316 The core is upgraded to 1.4, and a system title component is added, as well as a lot of detailed modifications.**

- **20230302 The development source code of mobile terminal data screen and splicing screen is integrated into the development kit.**

- **20230223 Release the development kit to Gitee and Github for the first time, and the documents are released simultaneously**



A free version may be released without the features of themes and multilingualism, and with fewer components. The list of components available for free commercial use is as follows (preliminary):

- Adaptive components (isometric mode only)
- Chart components
- Technology panels (about 10-12)
- Technology headings
- Block headings
- loading
- SVG backgrounds

These components are basically sufficient for an average commercial project, as for other features, they are only available in the premium version. The free version allows you to add any three-way component or custom component to implement other features.

The time frame is uncertain, after all the author is developing it in his spare time, it will probably be released in 3-6 months.
